// It is here rather than in either phase because the migration runner sizes the
// connection pool from the same number the phases cap themselves with — threads
// scaled above the connection budget would just queue on the sql.DB pool,
// buying no parallelism — and three copies of "2 ×" invite drift. Callers with
// an extra rule of their own wrap this rather than reimplementing it (see
// throttler.ResolveMaxWriteThreads, which additionally refuses to grow the write
// pool when the redo-aware signal has no commit-latency backstop).

// otherwise under-budget the connection pool for a phase that always runs at
// least one worker.

// read and write pools using the applier queue, while the checksum has a single
// pool and no arbitration to do.

//     exactly the moment the server is most overloaded.
//  2. The veto, which therefore outranks Shed, Grow and Hold. Utilization can
//     show plenty of headroom while a caller-visible prerequisite falls behind.
