// DiffCreateTables compares two CREATE TABLE statements and returns a runnable
// ALTER TABLE statement describing how they differ, or an empty string if they
// are equivalent under opts.
//
// The comparison is performed by parsing both statements and diffing the
// structured form via CreateTable.Diff, so it is insensitive to the textual
// noise two servers can put in SHOW CREATE TABLE output. What is and isn't
// compared is controlled by opts; with NewDiffOptions the comparison:
//   - ignores AUTO_INCREMENT counter values (instance-specific noise),
//   - ignores ENGINE and ROW_FORMAT cosmetic defaults,
//   - DOES compare column types, nullability, defaults, and per-column /
//     per-table CHARACTER SET and COLLATE,
//   - DOES compare indexes (including the primary key) and constraints.
//
// "want" is the schema treated as the source of truth; "got" is the schema
// being validated against it. The returned statement describes the
// transformation that would turn "got" into "want", which is what makes the
// message actionable. "table" is the real (logical) table name used to build
// the runnable "ALTER TABLE <table>" prefix, escaped so identifiers containing
// backticks remain valid — the two CREATE TABLE statements themselves may name
// tables on different instances, so their names are normalized away before the
// diff and never compared.
//
// If opts is nil, NewDiffOptions() defaults are used.
