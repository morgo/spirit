// AuroraSetup orchestrates probing for Aurora and assembling the Aurora-
// specific throttlers (commit-latency + the Aurora threads signal). It exists
// so both the migration runner and the move runner can wire up the same
// throttlers without duplicating the IsAurora / monitor-pool / construct dance.
//
// The throttler package intentionally does not import dbconn — opening the
// monitor pool happens via the caller-supplied OpenMonitor closure, which
// lets the caller own DSN, TLS, and pool sizing.
//
// The two Aurora throttlers are independent signals and have independent
// gates. Disabling one does not disable the other — see Build for details.
type AuroraSetup struct {
	// Source is the caller's main *sql.DB. Used only for the one-shot IsAurora
	// probe and the redo-aware privilege probe — cheap and run once at setup,
	// so sharing the main pool is fine.
	Source *sql.DB

	// OpenMonitor opens a dedicated *sql.DB used exclusively by the Aurora
	// throttlers for recurring polls. Called at most once, only after
	// IsAurora has returned true and at least one Aurora throttler is
	// going to be constructed, so non-Aurora callers never pay the
	// connect cost. The caller owns closing the returned DB — see
	// AuroraResult.MonitorDB.
	OpenMonitor func() (*sql.DB, error)

	// CommitLatencyThreshold gates the commit-latency throttler. A non-
	// positive value disables that throttler only — the Aurora threads
	// throttler is independent and is always enabled once Aurora is detected
	// (it reads only performance_schema, which the IsAurora probe already
	// proved is at least partly readable).
	CommitLatencyThreshold time.Duration

	Logger *slog.Logger
}

// AuroraResult is the output of AuroraSetup.Build. When Throttlers is empty
// MonitorDB is nil — there's no pool to close. When Throttlers is non-empty
// MonitorDB is non-nil and the caller owns its lifecycle.

	// ProbeErr is the IsAurora probe's error, when it failed. Throttlers is
	// then empty. Build treats a failed probe as "not Aurora" so throttling
	// stays quiet on community MySQL, but an autoscaling caller wants to warn:
	// it was asked to scale and cannot tell whether it should.
	ProbeErr error

	// RedoAware reports whether the threads throttler runs the redo-aware
	// perf_schema signal rather than the Threads_running fallback. That signal
	// ignores redo-log waiters, so it cannot see write threads oversubscribing
	// the log; ResolveMaxWriteThreads takes it to decide whether growth needs
	// the commit-latency backstop. False when Throttlers is empty.
	RedoAware bool
}

// Build probes the source for Aurora and assembles the Aurora throttlers.
//
// On a confirmed Aurora source the threads throttler is always built; the
// commit-latency throttler is built only when CommitLatencyThreshold > 0.
//
// The threads throttler is built in one of two modes, chosen by a privilege
// probe (CanReadRedoAwareThreads):
//   - redo-aware (preferred) when the user has SELECT on
//     performance_schema.threads and events_waits_current — it excludes
//     redo-log waiters so the copy can oversubscribe the log;
//   - Threads_running from global_status otherwise — the more conservative
//     fallback, which needs no grant beyond what IsAurora already exercised.
//
// Returns an AuroraResult with no throttlers, a nil monitor DB, and a nil
// error when the source is not Aurora, and the monitor pool is never opened.
// That covers two cases:
//   - the IsAurora probe returned false: the result is zero;
//   - the probe failed (non-Aurora source, or perf_schema not readable;
//     logged at Debug so the common case stays quiet): the result is zero
//     except ProbeErr, which holds the probe's error. Callers that only
//     throttle can ignore it; callers that were asked to autoscale should
//     warn, since they cannot tell whether the source is Aurora.
//
// Returns a non-nil error only for setup failures the caller almost
// certainly wants to surface: nil required fields, OpenMonitor failing, or
// throttler construction failing.
