// The Aurora "threads" throttler — the second Aurora signal, from issue #831.
//
// Like gh-ost and pt-osc, we use a running-thread count to detect server
// busyness and back off when the box is under load. What's different from those
// tools is that we compare the count to the instance vCPU count — which on
// Aurora we read deterministically from @@innodb_buffer_pool_instances — and
// that we feed it to the write-thread autoscaler as a continuous utilization
// signal, not only as a binary stop/go.
//
// The throttler runs in one of two modes, chosen once at setup by
// AuroraSetup.Build from a privilege probe (see CanReadRedoAwareThreads):
//
//   - redoAwareMode (preferred): counts Query-state threads from
//     performance_schema and SUBTRACTS those parked on redo-log flush. Those
//     waiters are IO-bound, not on CPU, and Aurora group-commits them to
//     storage, so the redo log can be safely oversubscribed — the #971 staging
//     A/B measured ~18% more copy throughput this way (~12 workers / ~25m vs ~8
//     workers / ~30.5m on an r6g.4xlarge). It requires SELECT on
//     performance_schema.threads and events_waits_current.
//
//   - globalStatusMode (fallback): counts ALL running threads via the
//     Threads_running status variable from global_status. It needs no grant
//     beyond the global_status access that IsAurora and the commit-latency
//     throttler already require, so it is always available once Aurora is
//     detected. Redo-log waiters read as load here, so it caps concurrency near
//     vCPUs rather than oversubscribing the log — more conservative, but it
//     works for accounts without the perf-schema grants above.
//
// History: this began (issue #831) as the redo-aware signal, was briefly
// replaced wholesale by Threads_running when staging diagnostics were misread as
// showing the redo-flush wait event never matched on Aurora (commit 11afb7bf),
// then the #971 A/B established that the event does match on Aurora and the
// exclusion works (commit 893f49f7). This revives the redo-aware signal as the
// default while keeping Threads_running as the no-extra-grant fallback.
//
// The commit-latency throttler, reading the same global_status, watches storage
// saturation directly; in redoAwareMode it is also the backstop that lets the
// autoscaler scale write threads above the starting value (see
// ResolveMaxWriteThreads).
const (
	// redoAwareThreadsQuery counts query-running threads on the server and
	// subtracts those parked on redo-log waits. LEFT JOIN handles the case
	// where events_waits_current has no row for a thread (e.g., the wait
	// consumer is disabled) — that thread is then counted as on-CPU, which is
	// the safe-conservative behavior.
	//
	// The sampling connection excludes itself (CONNECTION_ID()) — without this
	// the monitor's own query always counts as one active thread, which on
	// small instances (vCPUs=2) eats half the headroom and can throttle a
	// migration with no other activity on the server. The sibling
	// commit-latency poller on the shared monitor pool is NOT excluded (it has
	// a different connection id); redoAwareMode's headroom covers it.
	//

	// exist on community MySQL, but this query only runs on Aurora (gated by
