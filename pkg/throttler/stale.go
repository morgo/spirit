// Staleness guard for polled throttle signals.
//
// The throttlers sample on a background loop and cache the result; readers
// only see the cache. If sampling fails persistently (monitor connections
// partitioned, grants revoked mid-migration, a failover the pool won't
// reconnect from), the poll loop logs and continues — and the cached value
// freezes at whatever it was when things were last healthy. The guard tracks
// the time of the last successful sample so a throttler can stop trusting a
// frozen value once it is older than staleSignalThreshold. What "stop
// trusting" means depends on what the signal protects:
//
//   - The Aurora gradual throttlers (CommitLatency, AuroraThreads) apply the
//     guard to Utilization() only. A value frozen below the autoscaler's low
//     watermark would add a write thread every cooldown until the 2x cap,
//     ramping blind on a dead signal — so while stale, Utilization() reports
//     StaleUtilizationHold, a value inside the autoscaler's dead band,
//     freezing scaling in place (no growth, no shrink) until sampling
//     recovers. Their binary IsThrottled()/BlockWait() are deliberately NOT
//     touched by the guard: these signals are best-effort load protection,
//     and the hard-stop keeps reporting the last computed state exactly as
//     before, fresh or stale.
//
//   - The Replica throttler applies the guard to IsThrottled() itself and
//     fails closed. Its lag tolerance (--replica-max-lag) is a hard budget,
//     and a lag value frozen at a healthy level would let the copy run at
//     full speed against a budget nobody is measuring — so while stale,
//     IsThrottled() reports true, pausing the copy until polling recovers.

	// staleSignalThreshold is how old the last successful sample may be
	// before the cached value is no longer trusted. Three poll intervals
	// (commitLatencyPollInterval, threadsRunningPollInterval and the replica
	// throttler's loopInterval are all 5s): one or two failed or slow polls —
	// a brief failover blip, one stalled status query — don't flap the guard,
	// but the signal is declared stale before the autoscaler can take more
	// than one blind step, since its increases are spaced
	// (acCooldownTicks+1)*acTick = 15s apart.

	// StaleUtilizationHold is the utilization reported while the signal is
	// stale. It must sit inside the autoscaler's dead band [low, high) —
	// currently [0.4, 0.7) — so a stale signal holds the write-thread count
	// steady rather than ramping it or shrinking it. 0.55 is the midpoint,
	// keeping maximum distance from both watermarks if they ever move.
	// Exported so the autoscaler tests can pin this invariant.
	StaleUtilizationHold = 0.55

// staleGuard tracks the freshness of a polled signal. It is embedded by the
