// GradualOnly returns a view of t that reacts only to its children whose signal
// is continuous — the ones implementing GradualThrottler, i.e. the Aurora
// load signals. Binary-only children (replica lag) are dropped. If t has no
// gradual signal at all the result is a Noop, and if every child already has one
// t is returned unchanged.
//
// This exists for consumers that do not *cause* what a binary throttler is
// protecting: the checksum reads inside a REPEATABLE READ snapshot and produces
// no binlog events, so pausing it on replica lag cannot reduce that lag, while
// the extra time holds the snapshot open and pins undo the purge thread cannot
// advance past. Load signals are different in kind — a checksum does add read
// load to the primary, so backing off on load is both effective and warranted.
//
// The returned view does not own the lifecycle of the throttlers it wraps: its
// Open, Close and UpdateLag are no-ops, because the composite it was derived
// from is still the thing being opened, polled and closed. It is intended for
// consumers that only ask IsThrottled/BlockWait/Utilization.
