// revertMarkerName is the table an operator creates to ask an in-flight reverse
// window to roll back. Like the pre-cutover sentinel (pkg/sentinel), it is a
// coordination signal expressed as a table's existence — the difference is
// polarity: the sentinel is created by the move and dropped by the operator to
// proceed, whereas the revert marker is created by the operator to trigger a
// rollback.
//
// The reverse-window driver polls for it on targets[0] (where the checkpoint
// also lives). A stale marker (from a prior reverse-window move that did not
// complete) makes a new move refuse at pre-flight/pre-cutover; the marker is
// removed by the terminal action (complete-forward or reverse cutover). Keeping
// the trigger in its own table decouples the operator-owned signal from the
// move-owned checkpoint row.
