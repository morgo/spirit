//     legitimately differs from a sharded target that drops AUTO_INCREMENT in
//     favor of a Vitess sequence; the difference does not affect copy
//     correctness, so it must not block a move into a pre-created target.
//
// "want" is treated as the source-of-truth (e.g. sources[0] or the move source);
// "got" is the schema being validated (another source, or a pre-created target).
//
// This is the comparison for two schemas that must be IDENTICAL — today
// sources[0] against every other source (source_schema_consistency). Use
// TargetSchemaDiff for a source→target comparison, which additionally forgives
// a target that is deliberately stricter.

// TargetSchemaDiff compares a move's SOURCE table against a pre-created TARGET
// table and returns a runnable ALTER TABLE statement describing how they differ,
// or an empty string if the move will accept the target as it stands. It is the
// comparison the source→target checks use (target_state, resume_state).
//
// Two divergences are tolerated, and only these two. Both are a target that is
// deliberately stricter or leaner than the unsharded source it moves from, so
// that a declaratively-managed target does not have to mirror artifacts of its
// source:
//
//   - the source's column-level AUTO_INCREMENT may be absent on the target,
//     whose ids come from elsewhere (e.g. a Vitess sequence);
//   - a column the source declares nullable may be NOT NULL on the target — a
//     shard key, typically, which cannot be NULL in a sharded keyspace.
//
// Anything else is a difference, the reverse of either included: a target looser
// than its source fails, as does any change to types, charset, collation,
// indexes or constraints. See statement.DiffCreateTables for the
// canonicalization rules underneath.
//
// It is exported because "which divergences does a move tolerate" must have
// exactly one definition. A caller that wants to know in advance whether a move
// will accept a given target — strata's `keyspace move-tables` previews it
// before the operator confirms anything — would otherwise reassemble the option
// set by hand, and drift in either direction is a bug: the caller blocks a move
// that would have succeeded, or promises one that fails here in pre-flight.
// Adding to or removing from the tolerated set is therefore a change in public
// behaviour, not an internal one.
//
// The nullability tolerance exists because refusing it forced a choice. A
// Vitess primary vindex cannot map NULL to a keyspace id, so a sharded target
// must declare its shard key NOT NULL — while the source may still permit NULL
// because the ALTER to tighten it was never affordable on a multi-terabyte
// unsharded table. Without this, an operator had to pick between a correct
// target schema and being able to move into it at all.
//
// The relaxation cannot mask a NULL that actually exists. On a sharded target
// the row never reaches an INSERT: the applier hashes the shard key first and a
// NULL fails there. For any other tightened column, both copy paths write with
// INSERT IGNORE (the copier's INSERT IGNORE ... SELECT, the applier's
// INSERT IGNORE ... VALUES), and IGNORE downgrades the would-be
// ER_BAD_NULL_ERROR to a warning and stores the type's implicit default
// instead — regardless of row count, so this does not depend on batching. The
// checksum then reports the mismatch, because ColumnMapping.ChecksumExprs
// compares an explicit ISNULL() digit per column, which differs even for a
// VARCHAR NOT NULL whose implicit default is the empty string.
//
// So the outcome is a failed move, never a silently altered value — but it is
// an expensive failure: the initial checker runs with FixDifferences and three
// retries, so each attempt re-copies the chunk, re-coerces the NULL, and finds
// it again before the run gives up. Callers that want the failure in seconds
// rather than hours should probe the tightened columns for NULLs before
// starting the copy.
//
// One note for maintainers: what is exported is this function and not the
// options it builds, deliberately. The nullability tolerance is directional —
// statement.IgnoreNotNullRelaxation lets the schema being *validated* be
// stricter than its *reference*, and here the target is the validated schema, so
// it must reach DiffCreateTables as "got" with the source as "want". Handing a
// caller the options would hand them that trap: passed the other way round they
// forgive the opposite, dangerous direction, silently and with no diff to show
// for it. The parameter names below are what prevents that, which is why the
// option and the argument order never leave this function.
