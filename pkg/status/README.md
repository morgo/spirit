# Status

The `status` package provides state management, progress reporting, and periodic task monitoring for Spirit migrations. It defines the lifecycle states that a migration passes through and the infrastructure for background checkpointing and status logging.

## State Machine

`State` is an `int32` enum representing the current phase of a migration. It uses `atomic.LoadInt32`/`atomic.StoreInt32` for lock-free concurrent access, since the migration runner and watcher goroutines read and write the state simultaneously.

The states are defined in lifecycle order:

`Initial` → `CopyRows` → `WaitingOnSentinelTable` → `ApplyChangeset` → `RestoreSecondaryIndexes` → `AnalyzeTable` → `Checksum` → `PostChecksum` → `CutOver` → `Close` → `ErrCleanup`

This ordering is deliberate — the code uses ordinal comparisons (e.g., `state >= CutOver`) to determine when to stop checkpointing and status reporting.

## Task Interface

The `Task` interface defines the contract that a migration runner must implement: reporting progress, returning a status string, dumping checkpoints, and cancelling. Both the `migration.Runner` and `move.Runner` implement this interface.

## Background Monitoring

`WatchTask` launches two background goroutines:

1. **Status logger**: Logs `task.Status()` every 30 seconds until the migration reaches cutover. This provides a regular heartbeat in the logs.
2. **Checkpoint dumper**: Calls `task.DumpCheckpoint()` every 50 seconds until cutover. If a checkpoint write fails (with anything other than `ErrWatermarkNotReady` or `context.Canceled`), the task is **cancelled immediately**. The rationale is that it is better to fail early than to discover after a multi-day migration that progress was never being saved.

The checkpoint dumper also handles a race condition where the state transitions past cutover mid-checkpoint — the checkpoint table may have already been dropped, so this case is handled gracefully rather than treated as an error.

## Progress Reporting

`Progress` is a struct (not just a string) containing the current state and a summary. It is designed as a struct specifically to allow future expansion for GUI wrappers and external tooling.
