// embed it in place of a bare State field so that state transitions and phase
// timing cannot drift apart, and so per-phase durations no longer need ad-hoc
// fields on the runner (copyDuration, sentinelWaitStartTime, ...).

// The zero value is ready for use.
//
// Phases with a clear extent run under Do, which times exactly the function it
// brackets. Set remains the primitive for transitions whose "phase" has no
// meaningful end from the setter's perspective (Close, ErrCleanup); it closes
// out the previous state's running interval, matching the historical "one
// state ends when the next starts" semantics.
