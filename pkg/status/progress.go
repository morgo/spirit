	// server is not reported as pausing a cutover or a sentinel wait, because
	// nothing there is reading that signal.
	Throttled bool

	// Reason names the signal and the comparison that tripped it, in the form
	// "<signal> <observed> <op> <threshold>" — e.g. "commit-latency 128ms >= 100ms"
	// or "redo-aware 24 > 17". When several signals throttle at once they are
	// joined with "; ", because clearing only one of them will not resume the
	// copy.
	//
	// It is intended for display, not for branching: it is "" when Throttled is
	// false, and may also be "" when the configured throttler cannot explain
	// itself (see throttler.ReasonedThrottler).
	//
	// It is also sampled independently of Throttled rather than atomically with
	// it, so on a signal that is changing underneath the poll the two can
	// disagree: a throttler that clears in between yields Throttled with an
	// empty Reason, and a reason can quote a comparison that has just stopped
	// holding. Both are display-level staleness on a value that is a snapshot
	// anyway — not a bug to report.

	// 1.0 is exactly at that point, >1.0 is over it, and lower values are

	// limit" rather than only a long ETA.
	//
	// 0 is ambiguous and must not be rendered as idle. It is also what this
	// field reports when no continuous load signal exists at all — notably when
	// throttling is replica-lag-only, which is a budget rather than a load gauge
	// (see throttler.GradualThrottler). A copy paused on replica lag therefore
	// reports Throttled with Utilization 0, so a wrapper drawing a load gauge
	// should treat 0 as "unknown" and hide it rather than show an idle server.

	// over. CurrentState is deliberately left alone — callers parse it for phase
