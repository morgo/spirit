// Control-loop tunables. The shape is "gentle in the normal regime, abrupt
// only in emergencies": ±1 thread at a time, cooldown-gated, with a
// multiplicative halving reserved for utilization at/above the point where
// the hard-stop engages anyway.
//
// Two properties of the utilization signal dictate this shape (issue #831;
// observed in staging):
//
//   - It is largely self-induced. On a quiet server the running-thread count
//     is mostly our own write workers, so the controller's output feeds its
//     own input. Classic AIMD halving — built for congestion signals
//     dominated by other parties' traffic — overshoots badly here: each
//     halving cuts the signal roughly in half too, and the controller
//     sawtooths between the watermark and half of it indefinitely.
//   - It is a noisy instantaneous gauge. Threads_running blips on brief
//     latch/lock waits and on spirit's own housekeeping (checkpoints, GTID
//     flushes, status queries), so a single sample is a poor estimate of
//     sustained load. The throttler smooths it with an EWMA, and small,
//     cooldown-spaced steps let the controller track the trend instead of
//     chasing the noise.
//
// Zones, evaluated each tick against the (smoothed) utilization by
// autoscale.Classify:
//
//	util < autoscale.LowWatermark                        add one thread (cooldown-gated)
//	[autoscale.LowWatermark, autoscale.HighWatermark)    hold
//	[autoscale.HighWatermark, autoscale.PanicThreshold)  shed one thread (cooldown-gated)
//	util >= autoscale.PanicThreshold                     halve (first breach immediate)
//
// The dead band must be wider than the utilization step of a single thread (at
// most 1/vCPUs, and >= 0.25 only when vCPUs < autoscale.MinVCPUs, where the
// runner disables autoscaling entirely) — otherwise one +1 can vault across the
// band and ping-pong with the -1 path.
//
// The band has hysteresis, so the resting point depends on which side it is
// approached from. The write pool's derived start (vCPUs minus a small reserve)
// sits above the band, so on an idle server the controller sheds down and parks
// just under the high watermark — the first edge it meets — and holds there; it
// does not continue down to the low watermark (that is the floor it would climb
// up to had it started below the band, which is where the read pool begins and
// why that side ramps instead). Parking near 70% of vCPUs leaves headroom for
// the primary OLTP workload, and leaving copy throughput on the table is fine.
// Responsiveness to genuine overload is not traded away: that is the
// BlockWait hard-stop's job, which none of this touches.
//
// The thresholds, the zone classification, and the cooldown bookkeeping all live
// in pkg/autoscale, because the checksum controller applies the same law to its
// own pool and two copies would drift. The rationale above is the derivation;
// pkg/autoscale holds the mechanism. Note in particular that the panic zone
// compares the *gradual* (smoothed) utilization and never IsThrottled(): on a
// multi-throttler the latter would include binary children like replica lag,
// and halving on those is unguided — they already pause the copy, which makes
// the worker count moot while tripped.

// Queue-arbitration tunables. When read scaling is engaged (see
// enableReadScaling), utilization alone cannot decide which pool to grow:
// both pools feed the same signal, and two independent controllers sharing it
// would fight. The applier queue between them is the arbiter — it directly
// shows which side of the pipeline is the bottleneck:
//
//	queue ~empty, queue-wait ≈ 0     readers can't fill it  → read-starved
//	queue ~full,  wait ≥ write time  writers can't drain it → write-limited
//	anything else                    pipeline balanced      → hold
//
// A state must persist acQueueStatePersistTicks consecutive ticks before it
// arbitrates, so transient chunk-size swings (one huge chunk momentarily
// draining or flooding the queue) don't flap the controller between sides.
const (
	// acQueueStarvedOccupancy is the occupancy (QueueDepth/QueueCap) at or
