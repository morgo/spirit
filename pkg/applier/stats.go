// Stats is a point-in-time snapshot of an applier's write pipeline. It exists
// so status blocks and metrics can distinguish a read-limited pipeline (queue
// near empty) from a write-limited one (queue pegged at capacity with
// queue-wait far above write time) — without this, write-side saturation is
// invisible: the copier's end-to-end chunk feedback misattributes it to the
// read side. All fields are approximate; they are read without pausing the
// pipeline.

	// QueueDepth is the number of chunklets currently waiting in the
	// buffer(s) — summed across shards for the sharded applier.

	// RowsPerChunklet is the mean rows per chunklet since the applier started.
	// splitRowsIntoChunklets cuts on whichever of chunkletMaxRows or
	// MaxStatementSizeBytes binds first, and which one that is depends on the
	// table's width and column types — so it cannot be predicted from the
	// config, only measured. It matters because the chunklet is the unit of
	// nearly everything on the write path: one statement, one completion, one
	// handoff. A value at chunkletMaxRows means the row cap binds and raising
	// MaxStatementSizeBytes would do nothing.
	//
	// A value below the row cap does NOT by itself mean the byte cap binds:
	// the mean also drops when the batches handed to Apply() are small — each
	// chunk's remainder is a short chunklet, and on the sharded applier a
	// chunk is split per shard *after* fan-out, so the same chunk yields more,
	// shorter chunklets. The caps-question reading is only sound on the copy
	// path's large steady-state batches, where the remainder is noise; there,
	// well below the row cap means the byte cap is what's cutting.
	//
	// A mean rather than a percentile: the question is which cap is in force,
	// which the mean answers, and the last chunklet of every chunk is a short
	// remainder that would skew a low percentile.

	// Rolling percentiles over the last timingRingSize chunklets. Zero when no
	// chunklet has completed yet. Together these account for a write worker's
	// whole cycle, which matters when the pipeline stops responding to more
	// workers: each phase is limited by something different, and only one of
	// them is the target's write capacity.
	//
	// QueueWait is the time a chunklet spent between Apply() offering it to
	// the buffer and a write worker dequeueing it (including send-side
	// backpressure when the buffer is full).

	// to it; subtract it to get time actually spent at the server. A BuildTime

	// Handoff is the time a write worker spent publishing its completion after
	// the write finished. A single feedbackCoordinator goroutine drains those

	// slow callback shows up as backpressure on every write worker at once.

	// behind the completion path rather than the target, and adding workers

const buildShareThreshold = 0.25

// buildNoiseFloor keeps the share test from firing on a pipeline that is
// simply fast. A 300µs build against an 800µs write is 38% of it, but nothing

// self-contradictory "build-p50=0s". Below this the client cannot be the
// bottleneck whatever the share says.
const buildNoiseFloor = time.Millisecond

// String renders the snapshot as the applier row of a runner's status block, so
// migrate, move and sync report identical fields. Durations are rounded to the
// millisecond — finer precision is noise at status cadence. The fields are not
// prefixed with "applier-": the row is labelled, which is the whole point of
// the block layout.
//
// It renders a deliberately small subset of Stats, because the status block is
// read every 30 seconds by a human and a field that reads the same on every
// healthy run costs attention without paying it back (#329). Five fields are
// always present — queue occupancy, worker count, queue wait, and the write
// p50/p90 — because those are what you steer by.
//
// Two more appear only when they have something to say: build time when it is
// a large enough share of write time to mean the client is the bottleneck (and
// large enough in absolute terms to be worth reading), and handoff when it
// rises off the floor. Both diagnose a pipeline that has
// stopped responding to more write workers (see
// github.com/block/spirit/issues/1097), and both are silent on a healthy run —
// so their *presence* is the signal, and their absence is not a gap.
//
// Nothing is lost by trimming: every field stays on Stats, and the metrics
// sink emits them all, which is what dashboards should read anyway.
