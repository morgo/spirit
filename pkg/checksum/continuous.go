// Package checksum — continuous (eventually consistent) checker.
//
// ContinuousChecker is the post-copy verifier used by `spirit sync`. Unlike
// SingleChecker / DistributedChecker, it runs indefinitely against a live
// system where the target lags the source by some small replication delay,
// and it does so WITHOUT acquiring a table lock or holding a REPEATABLE READ
// snapshot. All reads are plain READ COMMITTED, issued directly through the
// source and target connections.
//
// # Convergence model
//
// A "pass" walks every chunk once, then drains a delayed-retry queue to
// empty. The pass completes only when every chunk has resolved — either
// READ-verified (its source and target CRCs observed equal on the initial
// read or on a retry), or repaired via a recopy when stable divergence is
// detected. A completed pass is "clean" only if it contained zero
// recopies; see the first-clean-pass section below.
//
// First-attempt failures are common — the target legitimately lags the
// source — so failures are not noisy events. They go through a retry queue:
//
//  1. On initial mismatch, record {originalSrcCRC, originalTgtCRC} and
//     enqueue with a not-before time of now+RetryDelay.
//  2. When the retry fires, re-read source and target (in parallel).
//     - If newTgtCRC == originalSrcCRC OR newTgtCRC == newSrcCRC → pass.
//       The target has caught up to a version of the source we have
//       witnessed. Remove from the queue.
//     - Else if newSrcCRC != originalSrcCRC → "hot chunk": the source kept
//       changing during the retry window. Replace originalSrcCRC with
//       newSrcCRC, increment consecutiveSrcChanged, re-enqueue at the tail
//       with a fresh not-before of now+RetryDelay.
//     - Else (newSrcCRC == originalSrcCRC, target still wrong) → stable
//       divergence. With a Recopier configured (production case), invoke
//       it to overwrite the chunk on the target from the source; on
//       success the chunk counts as resolved for pass-completion purposes
//       (in the per-pass "recopies" bucket), but the pass is no longer
//       clean — the repaired rows were never observed equal, so they are
//       re-verified by the next pass's fresh walk. Without a Recopier (or
//       when DivergenceIsFatal is set) the divergence is fatal — but first,
//       if a change feed is present, the checker drains it (Flush) and
//       re-reads: a target merely behind on applying buffered changes (apply
//       lag) reconciles here and passes, so only a mismatch that survives a
//       full drain returns ErrPermanentDivergence.
//
// Hot chunks slow but do not block pass completion: they cycle to the back
// of the FIFO while other entries resolve. A genuinely permanently-hot row
// will eventually fill the retry queue; the configurable MaxQueueSize then
// trips an error rather than letting the verifier silently fall behind.
//
// # First-clean-pass signal
//
// FirstCleanPass returns a channel that is closed the first time a pass
// completes with every chunk READ-verified equal AND zero recopies. A
// recopy is a repair, not a verification: the rewritten rows were never
// observed equal, and the recopy can race the live replication feed
// (re-inserting a row whose concurrent delete the feed already applied,
// leaving an orphan no future binlog event will remove). A pass that
// contained any recopy is therefore ineligible; the repaired ranges are
// re-read on the next pass's fresh walk, and the signal fires only once
// a full pass needs no repairs at all. The signal is monotonic: once
// fired it stays fired, even if subsequent passes detect new drift.
// Downstream consumers (e.g. the import feature that gates on "data is
// known consistent") read this channel; ongoing drift after that point is
// observable via Stats.
//
// # Concurrency
//
// N worker goroutines (default 4) consume work items via an internal
// channel. A single dispatcher goroutine — the pass driver — owns the
// retry queue and decides what to emit next: a fresh-walk chunk while the
// walker is producing, otherwise a retry entry whose not-before has
// elapsed. Workers do raw reads only; pass/retry policy lives in the
// driver so the FIFO and counters stay consistent.
