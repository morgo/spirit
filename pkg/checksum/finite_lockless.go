// on a table taking writes, and almost all of those resolve on retry; gating on

// migration. What makes the prefix trustworthy instead is that a chunk is
// reported to the chunker only once it has resolved clean (see
// feedbackResolved), so a chunk that was repaired, deferred, or split parks the
// watermark below itself.

// of the table, and so does the second pass within an attempt, so the live
// watermark can be behind one already published. Both describe a prefix that
// was observed equal and that the change feed has kept equal since, so the
