// A hot range is one whose source keeps changing under the reader. The snapshot
// fallback (lockless_snapshot.go) freezes the source row images for such a range
// and waits for the target to show them, which converges for a range that is
// merely busy — but not for a row that is written continuously. There, the
// frozen image is stale before the first poll, every attempt observes a
// different source, and the range is deferred to the next pass with no verdict
// at all. It is deferred again on the next pass for the same reason. A genuinely
// diverged hot row and a merely busy one are indistinguishable, forever.
//
// Settling is the terminal step for exactly that case, and it works by giving up
// on reading the source at all.
//
// Any comparison between a SELECT of the source and a read of the target is
// between a source image at one position and a target state at a later one.
// Closing that window means stopping the writes, and for a row that is written
// continuously the window is never empty. But the change stream already carries
// the answer: with binlog_row_image=FULL, an event's after-image *is* the
// source's value for that row at that position. MySQL says so; no read is
// needed, and nothing has to hold still.
//
// So for each row still outstanding:
//
//  1. Ask the feed to wait for the next change to that row and park there.
//  2. Flush, so the target holds exactly that image and nothing past it.
//  3. Compare the target row to the event's image.
//
// A mismatch at step 3 is a real inconsistency: the feed delivered that image
// and the flush applied it, so apply lag cannot explain a difference.
//
// This terminates in the opposite direction from a lock: the more often the row
// is written, the sooner its next event arrives. The rows that defeat every
// read-and-compare strategy are exactly the ones this settles fastest, and a row
// quiet enough that no event arrives inside the budget is one the ordinary poll
// was already converging on.
//
// Rows are settled one at a time. The escalation is rare by construction — a
// range reaches it only after exhausting MaxHotAttempts — and serializing keeps
// the feed's park a single piece of state rather than a set of overlapping holds.
//
// With several sources (a move), each row is settled on the feed of the source
// that owns it: the hot snapshot records which source each row was read from,
// and a key read from two sources never becomes a snapshot at all (see
// readHotSnapshotRowsAcross). The other feeds keep applying their own changes,
// which is safe because none of them writes that key. A row the target holds
// and no source does has no owner, so with several sources it defers.

//
// A bare "?" is right for most types and wrong for two, because UNION type
// merging *widens*: a value whose Go type is wider than the column takes the
// wider type into the merge, and the checksum's cast then renders it the way
// that wider type would be rendered rather than the way the column is.
//
//   - FLOAT is bound as a float64 (DecodeBinlogRow widens the binlog's
//     float32, and database/sql widens every float before binding). Merged
//     with the column that is a DOUBLE, and a char cast (a FLOAT -> VARCHAR
//     change) renders 0.1 as "0.10000000149011612" where the real row gives
//     "0.1". Casting the parameter back to FLOAT restores the column's
//     precision, so the merge is FLOAT with FLOAT.
//   - BIT is decoded as an int64, and what the real column renders depends on
//     the cast. A numeric cast (BIT -> BIT is cast to unsigned, BIT -> INT to
//     signed) renders its value, so the image binds it as a uint64: a BIT(64)
//     with the top bit set decodes negative, and binding the int64 as-is would
//     render -1 where the real row renders 18446744073709551615. Any other
//     cast (BIT -> VARCHAR is cast to char, BIT -> VARBINARY to binary)
//     renders the column's raw big-endian bytes — ceil(N/8) of them, at the
//     source column's width, so 0x05 for BIT(8) and 0x0000000000000005 for
//     BIT(64) — and the image binds those bytes. Either binding under the
//     other cast is wrong: CAST(x'05' AS signed) is 0, and a uint64 cast to
//     char renders "5".
//
// Both are silent: the query succeeds and returns a CRC that simply is not the
// row's, so every hot row in a table with a FLOAT or BIT column settles to a
// false divergence. Every other type the checksum handles renders the same
// either way — TestExpectedImageCRCMatchesRealRow pins that over the ones where
