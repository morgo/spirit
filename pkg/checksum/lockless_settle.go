// A hot range is one whose source keeps changing under the reader. The snapshot
// fallback (lockless_snapshot.go) freezes the source row images for such a range
// and waits for the target to show them, which converges for a range that is
// merely busy — but not for a row that is written continuously. There, the
// frozen image is stale before the first poll, every attempt observes a
// different source, and the range is deferred to the next pass with no verdict
// at all. It is deferred again on the next pass for the same reason. A genuinely
// diverged hot row and a merely busy one are indistinguishable, forever.
//
// Settling is the terminal step for exactly that case, and it works by giving up
// on reading the source at all.
//
// Any comparison between a SELECT of the source and a read of the target is
// between a source image at one position and a target state at a later one.
// Closing that window means stopping the writes, and for a row that is written
// continuously the window is never empty. But the change stream already carries
// the answer: with binlog_row_image=FULL, an event's after-image *is* the
// source's value for that row at that position. MySQL says so; no read is
// needed, and nothing has to hold still.
//
// So for each row still outstanding:
//
//  1. Ask the feed to wait for the next change to that row and park there.
//  2. Flush, so the target holds exactly that image and nothing past it.
//  3. Compare the target row to the event's image.
//
// A mismatch at step 3 is a real inconsistency: the feed delivered that image
// and the flush applied it, so apply lag cannot explain a difference.
//
// This terminates in the opposite direction from a lock: the more often the row
// is written, the sooner its next event arrives. The rows that defeat every
// read-and-compare strategy are exactly the ones this settles fastest, and a row
// quiet enough that no event arrives inside the budget is one the ordinary poll
// was already converging on.
//
// Rows are settled one at a time. The escalation is rare by construction — a
// range reaches it only after exhausting MaxHotAttempts — and serializing keeps
// the feed's park a single piece of state rather than a set of overlapping holds.

// A bare "?" is right for most types and wrong for two, because UNION type

// that wider type would be rendered rather than the way the column is.
//
//   - FLOAT is decoded as a float32, and database/sql widens every float to a
//     float64 before binding. Merged with the column that is a DOUBLE, and
//     CAST(... AS char) renders 0.1 as "0.10000000149011612" where the real row
//     gives "0.1". Casting the parameter back to FLOAT restores the column's
//     precision, so the merge is FLOAT with FLOAT.
//   - BIT is decoded as an int64, which merges to an integer and renders in
//     decimal ("5"), where casting the real column yields its raw big-endian
//     bytes — ceil(N/8) of them, so 0x05 for BIT(8) and 0x0000000000000005 for
//     BIT(64). Binding those bytes reproduces it exactly.
//
// Both are silent: the query succeeds and returns a CRC that simply is not the
// row's, so every hot row in a table with a FLOAT or BIT column settles to a
// false divergence. Every other type the checksum handles renders the same
// either way — TestExpectedImageCRCMatchesRealRow pins that over the ones where
