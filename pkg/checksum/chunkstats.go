// chunkObserver accumulates per-chunk timings and row counts for one checksum
// pass and renders a one-line summary when the pass ends.
//
// It exists to answer a specific question with data rather than guesswork:
// which ceiling is actually binding on checksum chunk size. The checksum
// shares --target-chunk-time with the copier, but its chunks are far cheaper
// (the CRC is aggregated server-side, so only one row per chunk crosses the
// wire) and the dynamic sizer is also bounded by table.MaxDynamicRowSize. If
// most chunks sit at that row cap well inside the time target, then raising
// the time target alone would change nothing, and the row cap is the thing to
// revisit. rowCapped counts exactly that case.
//
// Safe for concurrent use: every checksum worker records into it.
