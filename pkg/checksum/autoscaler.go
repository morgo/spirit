	// one step per flush (30s), so growth is three times faster. If a single
	// favourable flush cleared the verdict, a feed that is losing ground on
	// balance but not monotonically would have its sheds more than undone by the
	// grows in between, and the controller would net-grow while the feed fell

	// silence — long enough that a slow flush or a phase boundary cannot trip it.
	//
	// Silence is not the same as "nothing to report", because the signal is keyed
	// on the flush counter and the counter only advances when a flush *completes*.
	// A flush that keeps erroring returns before recording anything
	// (binlogClient.flush), and the periodic flusher logs the error and carries on
	// rather than failing the migration — so the counter can freeze while the
	// backlog grows without bound. A flush that merely takes minutes freezes it
	// too. Both mean the feed is not coping, and in both the last verdict was
	// computed against data that has stopped arriving; without this the scaler
	// would keep serving that stale verdict (false, by default) and Aurora growth
	// would proceed against a backlog nothing is draining.

// checksumScaler adjusts the checksum phase's live worker count for the
// duration of one pass.
//
// It applies the same utilization zone law as the copier's autoscaler (see
// pkg/autoscale), with two differences that follow from what the checksum
// phase actually is:
//
//  1. One pool, no arbitration. The copier's dual controller uses the applier
//     queue to decide whether to grow the read or the write side. The checksum
//     has no such queue: each chunk's read and aggregate happen inside one
//     goroutine, server-side, so there is only one pool to size.
//
//  2. A change-feed backlog veto, which works everywhere. The utilization
//     signal comes only from the Aurora throttlers (they are the ones that
//     implement throttler.GradualThrottler), so on stock MySQL there is
//     nothing continuous to control on and the controller cannot grow. But
//     every deployment can observe the one thing that matters during a
//     checksum: whether the change feed is keeping up. The feed flushes
//     concurrently with the checksum, and its backlog is what gates cut-over
//     (and, if it grows unboundedly, what risks the binlogs being purged
//     before a resume can replay them). If the feed is losing ground, our
//     reads are winning a race against writes that actually have to finish,
//     so we shed — on Aurora and stock MySQL alike.
//
//     "Losing ground" is specifically a rising *post-flush residual*, not a
//     rising backlog, and it is read from change.Source.FlushResidual rather
//     than polled. The raw count rises between every pair of flushes on any
//     busy table, so its slope carries no information, and polling for its
//     troughs does not recover the residual either — a poll lands some fixed
//     fraction of an interval after the flush and so reads the residual plus
//     that fraction's worth of writes. What a healthy feed guarantees is that
//     each flush returns the backlog to near zero, and only the feed itself can
//     say what a flush left behind.
//
// So the capability matrix is:
//
//	                      hard stop   shed on backlog   grow
//	stock MySQL           yes         yes               no (back to start only)
//	Aurora + autoscaling  yes         yes               yes (utilization law)
//
// Both rows assume scaling is enabled, because this type is only constructed
// then; without the opt-in a checksum has the hard stop and nothing else, and
// never moves its worker count in either direction.
//
// The hard stop (throttler.BlockWait) is not this type's job — the dispatch
// loop calls it directly, and it remains the safety net underneath whatever
// the controller decides.

//     per cooldown at exactly the moment the server is most overloaded.
//  2. The backlog veto, which therefore outranks Grow, Hold and Shed.
