// Package checksum — lockless (optimistic) checker.
//
// LocklessChecker verifies live source/target tables with optimistic reads
// and retries. Unlike SingleChecker / DistributedChecker, it does not acquire a
// table lock or hold a long-lived REPEATABLE READ snapshot. All reads are plain
// READ COMMITTED, issued directly through the source and target connections.
//
// One checker serves both halves of the Checker contract, over the same pass
// loop: Run returns once a pass has verified the whole table (retrying the run
// on transient failure, and bounded by MaxPasses when it will not converge),
// and RunContinuous keeps passing in the background until it is cancelled.
// RunUntilClean is a single attempt of Run, without the retry loop.
//
// # Convergence model
//
// A "pass" walks every chunk once, then drains a delayed-retry queue to
// empty. The pass completes only when every chunk has resolved — either
// READ-verified (its source and target CRCs observed equal on the initial
// read or on a retry), or repaired via a recopy when stable divergence is
// detected. A completed pass is "clean" only if it contained zero
// recopies; see the first-clean-pass section below.
//
// First-attempt failures are common — the target legitimately lags the
// source — so failures are not noisy events. They go through a retry queue:
//
//  1. On initial mismatch, record {originalSrcCRC, originalTgtCRC} and
//     enqueue with a not-before time of now+RetryDelay.
//  2. When the retry fires, re-read source and target (in parallel).
//     - If newTgtCRC == originalSrcCRC OR newTgtCRC == newSrcCRC → pass.
//       The target has caught up to a version of the source we have
//       witnessed. Remove from the queue.
//     - Else if newSrcCRC != originalSrcCRC → "hot chunk": the source kept
//       changing during the retry window. Replace originalSrcCRC with
//       newSrcCRC, increment consecutiveSrcChanged, re-enqueue at the tail
//       with a fresh not-before of now+RetryDelay.
//     - Else (newSrcCRC == originalSrcCRC, target still wrong) → stable
//       divergence. Before acting on it, if a change feed is present, the
//       checker drains it (Flush) and re-reads: a target merely behind on
//       applying buffered changes (apply lag) reconciles here and passes, so
//       only a mismatch that survives a full drain is acted on at all. With a
//       Recopier configured (production case), the checker then logs the
//       differing rows and invokes it to overwrite the chunk on the target
//       from the source; on success the chunk counts as resolved for
//       pass-completion purposes (in the per-pass "recopies" bucket), but the
//       pass is no longer clean — the repaired rows were never observed equal,
//       so they are re-verified by the next pass's fresh walk. Without a
//       Recopier configured it returns ErrPermanentDivergence.
//
// Two successive source changes trigger subdivision.
// Large ranges yield up to eleven children; mismatching descendants above 128
// rows subdivide immediately without waiting for new source-change evidence.
// Every child needs fresh verification. Split parents never count as passed.
// Depth, per-root (shared by descendants), and per-pass budgets bound work.
//
// Small unresolved hot ranges freeze a finite source
// PK/CRC image after a target-key census. Retries require actual matching target
// reads for those images and absence for observed target-only keys. Later inserts
// do not expand this work set. No stream-backed matches are accepted. Snapshots
// that exceed their row/byte budget fall back to normal retries; unresolved
// snapshots defer without making the pass clean.
//
// Hot chunks slow but do not block pass completion: they cycle to the back
// of the FIFO while other entries resolve. After MaxHotAttempts observations,
// a still-changing chunk is deferred to the next pass. The pass is not clean
// and the chunk is never reported as verified, but a small number of hot rows
// cannot leave one pass open forever. MaxQueueSize independently applies
// backpressure when many chunks are awaiting retries.
//
// # First-clean-pass signal
//
// FirstCleanPass returns a channel that is closed the first time a pass
// completes with every chunk READ-verified equal AND zero recopies. A
// recopy is a repair, not a verification: the rewritten rows were never
// observed equal, and the recopy can race the live replication feed
// (re-inserting a row whose concurrent delete the feed already applied,
// leaving an orphan no future binlog event will remove). A pass that
// contained any recopy is therefore ineligible; the repaired ranges are
// re-read on the next pass's fresh walk, and the signal fires only once
// a full pass needs no repairs at all. The signal is monotonic: once
// fired it stays fired, even if subsequent passes detect new drift.
// Downstream consumers (e.g. the import feature that gates on "data is
// known consistent") read this channel; ongoing drift after that point is
// observable via Stats.
//
// # Concurrency
//
// N worker goroutines (default 4) consume work items via an internal
// channel. A single dispatcher goroutine — the pass driver — owns the
// retry queue and decides what to emit next: a fresh-walk chunk while the
// walker is producing, otherwise a retry entry whose not-before has
// elapsed. Workers do raw reads only; pass/retry policy lives in the
// driver so the FIFO and counters stay consistent.

// feedbackResolved reports a resolved chunk to the chunker. It is the hinge the
// resume watermark hangs on: the chunker's watermark tracker advances over the
// contiguous prefix of chunks it has been given feedback for, so reporting a
// chunk only once it has been READ-verified makes chunker.GetLowWatermark()
// mean "every row below here was observed equal", which is exactly the evidence
// a resumed run may skip. A chunk that was repaired, deferred as hot, or split
// is deliberately never reported, so the watermark stops below it and a resume
// re-verifies from there. (Reporting at read time, as this did before, advanced
// the watermark over chunks that were still queued for retry.)
//
// Only walked chunks are reported. Split children are synthetic ranges the
// chunker never handed out, and feeding them back would corrupt its
// bookkeeping; splitting therefore parks the watermark at the parent, which is
// the conservative answer.
//
// The duration and row count are the fresh-walk read's, carried on the entry,
// so chunk sizing still sees the initial read rather than the slower retry
// path — just delivered later.
//
// Withholding feedback has a cost inside the chunker's watermark tracker: a
// chunk that is never fed back is never retired, so every chunk resolved after
// it stays buffered in the tracker's out-of-order map until the next Reset, and
// the tracker's in-flight count never returns to zero. The first repaired or
// deferred range in a large table therefore makes the pass's tracker memory
// O(remaining chunks), and chunker.IsRead() stays false for the rest of it.
// Nothing reads IsRead() on the checksum chunker today — the runner status
// block reads the copy chunker — but a future caller would be surprised. Both
// are consequences of the tracker having one signal for "this chunk is done"
// and "this chunk is verified"; separating them is tracked in block/spirit#1272
// rather than done here, because the watermark meaning above is what this
// change is for and it is correct as written.

// now in progress: every row below it was read on both sides and observed
// equal, so a resumed run may start there instead of at the beginning. It is
// the direct consequence of feedbackResolved — see that method for why the
// chunker's low watermark carries this meaning at all.
//
// A second pass resets the chunker and so resets this to nothing. The prefix
// the first pass verified is deliberately not carried over: the second pass
// exists because the first one repaired or deferred something, and if it now
// fails to re-verify a range the first pass verified, that range stopped being
// equal — exactly the case where reporting the older, further-along answer
// would let a resume skip the damage.
//
// Continuous verification reports nothing: it never finishes, so there is no
// run to resume, and a restart requires full initial verification.
//
// Unlike the snapshot checker there is no "any difference found ⇒ no evidence"
// gate here, and there does not need to be. Optimistic reads mismatch routinely
// on a table taking writes, and almost all of those resolve on retry; gating on
// the mismatch counter would discard the watermark on essentially every real
