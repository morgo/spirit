// Package sentinel implements the "sentinel table" cutover gate shared by the
// migration and move runners.
//
// When a migration/move is run with deferred cutover, spirit creates a small
// marker table (the sentinel) and then blocks the final cutover until an
// operator drops it. While blocked, a continuous checksum re-verifies the
// copied data so a long human-paced wait does not let the shadow copy drift.
//
// Both runners previously carried near-identical copies of this logic; the
// only differences were which connection/schema the sentinel lives on and the
// two runner-specific callbacks (RunChecksum, InvalidateWatermark), which are
// injected into Wait rather than reimplemented here.
