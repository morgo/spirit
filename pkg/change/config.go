	// (FatalReasonSchemaChange), or when a fatal stream error occurs, such as
	// minimal RBR detection or exhausted streamer recreation attempts
	// (FatalReasonStreamError). The caller is expected to handle cancellation
	// and cleanup, using reason to decide whether persisted resume state
	// (e.g. a checkpoint) must be invalidated (schema change) or is still
	// safe to resume from (stream error).
