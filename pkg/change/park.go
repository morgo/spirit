// Parking exists for one caller: the lockless checksum, verifying a row that is
// written continuously.
//
// Such a row cannot be verified by reading both sides. Any SQL comparison is
// between a source image at one position and a target state at a later one, and
// closing that window means stopping the writes. But the stream already carries
// the answer. With binlog_row_image=FULL, an event's after-image *is* the
// source's value for that row at that position — MySQL says so, no read
// required. So the verification is:
//
//	park the feed; wait for the next event for this row; park at it;
//	flush, so the target holds exactly that image; compare the target to it.
//
// A mismatch there is a real inconsistency: the feed just delivered that image
// and the flush just applied it, and nothing further has been admitted.
//
// This terminates in the opposite direction from a lock: the more often the row
// is written, the sooner the event arrives. The rows that defeat every
// read-and-compare strategy are exactly the rows this resolves fastest.
//
// A Source gets all of this by embedding a RowParker; see there for the three
// places to wire it in. One verification runs at a time.
//
// This park is unrelated to the memory-backpressure park, which blocks inside
// HasChanged when a subscription is over its soft limit. The two interact in
// one place. A watch is offered the change *before* HasChanged, so it does fire
// under backpressure — but the dispatch then blocks in HasChanged, and the
// verification is not woken until the change is buffered. So the verification
// times out and defers (correct, if useless: the caller was already deferring
// the range), and the dispatch reaches the park long after the verification is
// gone. That is what ParkedRow.abandon exists for.

// ErrRowRewritten means the watched row was written again before the
// verification could read the target, so the image the caller was handed is no
// longer what the target holds. The caller should retry.
