// contendingApplier reproduces the production failure mode in miniature: a
// REPLACE batch fails with a deadlock (1213) whenever another batch is in
// flight at the same time, and succeeds whenever it runs alone.
//
// That is exactly what a production deadlock dump showed: a three-way cycle
// between spirit's own concurrent REPLACEs against the new table, inverting
// between the PRIMARY index and a secondary UNIQUE index, with every
// transaction in the cycle owned by spirit's own connections. No external
// workload is needed to produce it, and nothing about the *content* of a batch
// makes it fail — only its concurrency.
//
// The in-memory applier returns in tens of microseconds, far too fast for
// concurrently-scheduled batches to reliably observe each other. Each call
// therefore waits at a barrier for expectConcurrent arrivals before deciding,
// so a genuinely concurrent pass always sees the overlap and a genuinely
// serial one always times out alone. That keeps "fails iff concurrent" — the
// property under test — deterministic rather than a timing race.
