// FatalGate is the change feed's fatal-condition handler

// is ready to use. A runner owns one gate for its lifetime and wires every
// change feed it starts to it, so a burst of fatal events from several feed
// goroutines is realistic: the gate acts on the first and ignores the rest.
//
// Datasync does not use it. It has no cutover to guard and always keeps its
// checkpoint (see change.FatalReason.PreservesCheckpoint).

// Trip aborts the run for reason. It returns false, and does nothing, once the
// run has reached cutover: the tables have been swapped, so there is nothing
// left to abort. Otherwise it returns true, and on the first call only:
//
//   - sets the state to status.ErrCleanup,
//   - logs reason's operator advice (change.FatalReason.Advice),
//   - drops the checkpoint unless reason leaves it resumable
//     (change.FatalReason.PreservesCheckpoint). A schema change, for example,
//     would otherwise block the run from proceeding permanently; starting
//     again is the better choice. A dead stream preserves it: that is exactly
//     the failure checkpoint resume exists to recover from.
//   - cancels the run with a status.FatalAbort cause.
//
// Doing these once keeps the side effects from racing each other and the
// runner's Close.
