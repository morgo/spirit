# Migration

The `migration` package is used to orchestrate schema changes to one or more tables. Each `change` is tracked in the runner, with the copier and checker largely agnostic that they may be copying multiple tables at once.

There is one change source (`change.Source`) for all changes, and a subscription is added for each table:

The copier and [change source](../change/README.md) are running in parallel during step 3. The only hard requirement is that the change source starts before the copier so we can ensure that all changes are tracked.

The copier is essentially a dirty-copy, in that each chunk does not correctly keep track of changes being made. This is reconciled via the change source, which detects any changes that have been made and applies them to the new table consistently.

Once copying is complete, a [checksum process](../checksum/README.md) is started. This ensures that all data has safely made it to the new table, and it is safe to cutover.

## What parts of the process are locking?

To answer this question, we need to understand that there are two types of locks:

1. **Data locks**, aka InnoDB row-level locks. These are configurable via `innodb_lock_wait_timeout`: the server default is 50s, but spirit overwrites this to 3s.
2. **Metadata locks** (MDL). These are configurable via `lock_wait_timeout`: the server default is 1 year(!), but spirit overwrites this to 30s (configurable by `--lock-wait-timeout`).

**By default, Spirit takes no data locks on the source table.** The default buffered copier reads rows into Spirit and writes them to `_new` through the applier (`REPLACE INTO _new VALUES (...)`), and the change source is likewise always buffered — it applies binlog row images and never runs `SELECT FROM original`. Neither path holds shared row locks on the source, so there is no copier-vs-OLTP contention on hot rows. (The applier's `REPLACE INTO` does take locks, but only on `_new`, which nothing else touches.) See [pkg/change/README.md](../change/README.md) for the subscription design.

Data locks only re-enter the picture if you opt into the legacy `--unbuffered` copier, which issues `INSERT IGNORE INTO _new ... SELECT FROM original`. The `SELECT` side takes shared row locks rather than using MVCC, so it can contend with production workloads touching the same rows. When using `--unbuffered`, the main knob to mitigate this is `target-chunk-time`: smaller chunks mean each copy statement holds locks for less time.

So the locking that *does* apply by default is **metadata locks**. When we describe Spirit as a "non-blocking schema change tool" that is a bit of a white lie: we don't hold an MDL for the entire 10h schema change, as built-in MySQL DDL often does, but we do need a brief exclusive MDL at a few points:

* Spirit initially attempts INSTANT/INPLACE DDL. If this is compatible, it requires an exclusive metadata lock on the table.
* Starting a checksum requires an initial exclusive metadata lock to ensure that all data is synchronized between the checksum threads.
* The cutover operation requires an exclusive metadata lock.

What causes all metadata lock issues? (hint: it's not spirit)

Any open transactions will have shared metadata locks on any of the tables that you are modifying. If you have long transactions that have not yet committed/rolled back, Spirit's exclusive lock will be queued waiting for them to finish. This then looks like a Spirit problem because any shared lock requests that arrive after Spirit's exclusive lock request will then be queued behind Spirit. So the solution is to keep your transactions as short as possible.

The _fix_ for Spirit, is that it will by default `force-kill` the specific connections that are blocking it from acquiring an exclusive lock. This can be disabled with `--skip-force-kill` if needed.

## Using Spirit `migration` as a Go package

I will assume that similar to our use-case, you are probably wrapping some sort of automation around Spirit. If this automation is written in Go, I would encourage you to use the Spirit API and not the CLI executable.

The following is a simplification of what we use ourselves:

```go
func (sm *Spirit) Execute(ctx context.Context, m *ExecutableTask) error {
	startTime := time.Now()
	runner, err := migration.NewRunner(&migration.Migration{
		Host:              m.Cluster.Host,
		Username:          m.Cluster.Username,
		Password:          &m.Cluster.Password,
		Database:          m.Cluster.DatabaseName,
		Statement:         m.Statement,
		TargetChunkTime:   m.TargetChunkTime,
		Threads:           m.Concurrency,
		LockWaitTimeout:   m.LockWaitTimeout,
		InterpolateParams: true,
	})
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrap(err, "failed to create spirit migration runner")
	}
	defer runner.Close()
	if m.Metrics != nil {
		runner.SetMetricsSink(m.Metrics)
	}
	sm.Lock()
	sm.progressCallback = func() string {
		return runner.Progress().Summary
	}
	sm.Unlock()
	runner.SetLogger(m.Logger)
	if err = runner.Run(ctx); err != nil {
		return errors.Wrap(err, "failed to run spirit migration")
	}
	m.Logger.Infof("spirit migration completed in %s", time.Since(startTime))
	return nil
}
```
