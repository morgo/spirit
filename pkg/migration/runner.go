//     then its re-read of the source on r.db rather than on the pooled read-view
//     transaction, and repairs are serialized under the checker's recopyLock —
//     so it is one connection at a time. (The rewrite itself goes through the
//     applier, whose write connections are already budgeted below as maxWrite;
//     the copy phase has finished by then, so that headroom is free.)
//   - Chunker prefetch. chunker.Next() runs a SELECT ... LIMIT 1 OFFSET n on
//     Ti.Db to find the next chunk boundary, also off-pool. Workers call it
//     concurrently but the chunker's own mutex serializes them, so only one
//     such query is ever in flight.
//
// This reserve matters more than it looks. The transaction pool is sized to the
// read ceiling and every one of its transactions pins a connection for the whole
// phase whether or not a worker has it checked out, so there is no incidental
// slack left to absorb either query — without the reserve, chunk dispatch would
