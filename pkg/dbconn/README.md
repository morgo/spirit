# Database Connections

The `dbconn` package provides MySQL database connection management and locking utilities for Spirit. It wraps `database/sql` with Spirit-specific concerns: retry logic, TLS auto-configuration, advisory locking, table locking, and the ability to kill blocking transactions.

## Connection Setup

When creating a new connection, Spirit appends standardized DSN parameters to ensure consistent behavior across all connections. These include setting `sql_mode=""` (to be able to copy legacy data like `0000-00-00`), `time_zone=+00:00`, `transaction_isolation=read-committed`, `charset=utf8mb4`, `collation=utf8mb4_bin`, and `rejectReadOnly=true` (for Aurora failover resilience). This means that regardless of the server's global configuration, Spirit connections behave predictably.

## TLS

Spirit supports five TLS modes: DISABLED, PREFERRED, REQUIRED, VERIFY_CA, and VERIFY_IDENTITY. The default is PREFERRED, which first attempts a TLS connection and falls back to plaintext if it fails. RDS hosts are auto-detected via hostname pattern matching (`*.rds.amazonaws.com`), and an embedded RDS CA bundle is used automatically.

## Retryable Transactions

`RetryableTransaction` is the primary mechanism for executing statements that may encounter transient errors. It classifies MySQL errors into retryable (deadlocks, lock wait timeouts, connection loss, read-only mode, killed queries) and fatal (everything else). On transient errors, the entire transaction is retried up to `MaxRetries` times.

An important subtlety is that `RetryableTransaction` inspects `SHOW WARNINGS` after every statement. This catches issues that MySQL does not surface as errors, such as `range_optimizer_max_mem_size` exceeded warnings. This particular warning is treated as fatal because it indicates a table scan will occur instead of an index range scan.

## Force Kill

Both `ForceExec` and `NewTableLock` implement a timer-based force-kill pattern. They wait for 90% of `LockWaitTimeout`, then query `performance_schema` to identify and kill transactions that are blocking metadata lock acquisition. This is enabled by default and can be disabled with Spirit's `--skip-force-kill` flag.

There are two important safety constraints:

1. **Transaction weight threshold**: Transactions with a weight above 1,000,000 (as reported by `information_schema.innodb_trx.trx_weight`) are never killed, because their rollback would be expensive and disruptive.
2. **Explicit table locks**: Connections holding `LOCK TABLES` are never killed. Instead, an `ErrTableLockFound` error is returned. This is because killing non-transactional locks is unsafe.

## Metadata Lock

`MetadataLock` provides an advisory locking mechanism using MySQL's `GET_LOCK()` function. It runs on a dedicated single-connection database pool with a background goroutine that periodically refreshes the lock. If the connection drops, it automatically reconnects and re-acquires locks.

Lock names are deterministic hashes of `schema.table`, truncated with a SHA1 suffix to fit MySQL's 64-character limit for lock names. This is used to prevent concurrent Spirit migrations on the same table.

## Table Lock

`TableLock` wraps MySQL's `LOCK TABLES ... WRITE` statement. It integrates with the force-kill mechanism to automatically kill blocking transactions if the lock cannot be acquired within the timeout. This is used during the cutover phase.

## Transaction Pool

`TrxPool` pre-creates a pool of `REPEATABLE READ` transactions with `START TRANSACTION WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT`. This ensures all worker threads see the same point-in-time data, which is essential for parallel checksum verification.
