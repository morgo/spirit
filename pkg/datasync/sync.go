// Package datasync implements the `sync` command: a continuous,
// heterogeneous data sync.
//
// A sync performs an initial copy of the source tables into the target,
// then streams ongoing changes from the source to the target
// indefinitely until the context is cancelled. Unlike `move`, there is
// no checksum and no cutover — the sync simply keeps the target caught
// up with the source for as long as it runs. Cancelling the command
// (SIGINT/SIGTERM, or a caller-cancelled context) drains the in-flight
// backlog and exits cleanly.
//
// The source is either a built-in MySQL binlog client (constructed from
// SourceDSN) or a caller-injected change.Source — e.g. a Vitess /
// PlanetScale VStream. The target is written through an applier; today
// that is a MySQL SingleTargetApplier, but the applier abstraction is
// what makes the sync heterogeneous: a future Postgres applier would
// let this sync MySQL → Postgres without changing the runner.
//
// The package is deliberately named datasync (not sync) so it does not
// shadow the standard library's sync package. The CLI command is still
// `sync` (the kong field name drives the command name, the same way
// migration.Migration is exposed as `migrate`).
